# Technical notes

This site is a full-stack demo deployed on AWS free-tier:

- Frontend: Next.js + TypeScript, static export to S3 behind CloudFront
- Backend: API Gateway + Lambda (contact form), DynamoDB for submissions, SES for mail
- IaC: AWS CDK (TypeScript) with separate stacks (Web, API, Observability)
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions with OIDC to AWS (no static keys)

Design goals: fast-first, accessible, serverless, and observable â€” reflecting the same rigor I bring to sales.

## Architecture highlights

- S3 is private; CloudFront uses OAI for origin access
- CloudFront has SPA fallback + strict security headers
- API CORS is locked down to the site origins
- Secrets in SSM/Secrets Manager; no secrets in the client

## Performance

- Static export with long TTLs for assets
- Minimal deps; typography with system fonts + one display family
- Lighthouse CI workflow to catch regressions

## Trade-offs

- Static export over SSR to reduce cost and complexity
- DynamoDB over RDS to stay inside free tier and keep ops light
