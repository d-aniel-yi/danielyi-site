## Cover Letter

Dear Hiring Team,

If you give me 15 seconds of your time, I can convince you that you’ve never seen a salesperson like me.

Go to my website, [da.nielyi.com](https://da.nielyi.com), and take a look around at a site with a fully functioning frontend and backend, hosted on AWS, created from the ground up by me. There are countless top-performing salespeople out there with similar resumes to mine, but I’m confident that you won’t find one with the curiosity, technical acumen, and entrepreneurial spirit that I do.

“Why biology?” is a question that I get often, and the answer is simply that I do not know why I chose biology as my major. I was a kid with an underdeveloped pre-frontal cortex, and had foresight into what my degree would lead to. Before I had my heart set on coaching football, I thought I could be a doctor, a physical therapist, or “Whatever, the degree doesn’t even matter.”

Clearly, I didn’t do any of those, and instead I landed in a career in sales. I always say that the best sales training I’ve ever gotten was tutoring. “If you can convince a kid to spend the time to learn math, you can convince an adult to buy” is the elevator pitch, but in reality, it’s so, so much more. To be a great tutor, you have to be a great listener. You have to care about what each student is struggling with, uncover the deeper gaps in their knowledge, and present solutions in a way that resonates with them. You can’t simply possess the answers to their problems - the students have to understand why it’s important.

I feel the same way about sales - having the right solution in front of the right person is only half the battle. Uncovering their pain points, what their needs truly are (below the surface level), and understanding their “why” is absolutely key. I think what makes me a great seller is that I’m a great listener. If you can truly, truly listen, everything else falls into place.

Currently, I’m one of the Co-Founders of Mobi Measure, a software startup built for the semiconductor industry, making image metrology more efficient. Sales is one of the many hats that I wear in this incredibly scary, yet fulfilling journey that I’ve embarked on, but we’re learning that there’s a strong chance the market and product market fit are not big enough for this to be a viable business, and I am to at a crossroads, deciding if I should pivot back into my sales career.

If this sort of entrepreneurial spirit combined with high sales performance and technical acumen is of interest to you, I would love to talk and see if closing up this startup venture I am on and joining your team would be a good fit!

Best wishes,

Daniel Yi
